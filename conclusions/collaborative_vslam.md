# Collaborative VSLAM

## why need collaborative vslam?
* achieve better robustness, efficiency and accuracy than single-agent vslam
* some situations:

    * Three dimensional maps produced from different drones are required to be fused to speed up the mission of exploration
    * For multi-user augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR), the user should also know the state of other users, and different users should be put into a unified coordinate system such that virtual objects can be seamlessly displayed at different individual devices
    * A potential solution to solve the challenge of dynamic environment in multi-agents
